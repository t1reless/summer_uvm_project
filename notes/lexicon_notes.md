Lexicon building: 
Two Primary Approaches
1. Dictionary  
	Static dictionary of semantically relevant words tagged with polarity and semantic orientation
	The dictionary is generated with a small set of seed words and an online dictionary such as 
	[WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) and [SentiWordNet](https://github.com/aesuli/SentiWordNet)
	Dictionary based approaches suffer from being context agnostic
	Corpus-based approaches use a domain corpus (to be defined) to capture words in context.
	
2. Corpus Based
